## Deliverables
[ ]  Implementation of an alternative/adjusted design process workflow (details will be worked out by  Dawn in collaboration with multiple designers and software engineers).
[ ]  Development of a dedicated playground environment for research and testing purposes, providing a practical, real-world illustration.
[ ] Creation of a comprehensive blog post presenting research findings, results, and conclusive insights.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Figma Sync
`tokens/export-tokens.json` is generated by token.studio in Figma. Those values are referenced in `src/theme/*` as vanilla-extract tokens.

### Workflow
1. Make changes to tokens in Figma and push to main to generate `tokens/export-tokens.json`
2. Run `npm run transform:tokens` to generate `tokens/transformed-tokens.json`. This removes any reference, which are not readable by style-dictionary. 
3. run `generate:tokens` to generate `./output/transformed-tokens.css` via style-dictionary.
3.1 run `generate:tokens-via-sd-transforms` to generate `./build/**` via sd-transforms.

## Notes
- Hot-reload vanilla-extract not working, so refresh after change is necessary
- Flags `--expandTypography`, `--expandShadow` need to be added while calling token-transform in order to spread the objects and to generate the correct output by style-dictionary. If not, the output will result in [object Object].
