# Figma-to-Code Optimization Playground

This project explores innovative approaches to optimize the workflow between Figma design and code implementation. The experimentation involved the following steps:

Design Token Creation: Utilizing Figma variables in both Figma itself and token.studio to define design tokens.

Repository Integration: The design tokens were exported to this code repository in JSON format.

Token Transformation Script: A script was developed to convert the JSON design tokens into a format suitable for practical use.

Integration with vanilla-extract: The transformed tokens were integrated into the codebase using vanilla-extract, enhancing maintainability and consistency.

Storybook Showcase: The tokens were showcased and tested through Storybook, providing a visual representation of the design system components.

This project serves as a testing ground for optimizing the collaboration between Figma and code, streamlining the design-to-development process for increased efficiency and consistency. Feel free to explore and contribute! ðŸš€

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

run the development server:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Figma Sync
`tokens/export-tokens.json` is generated by token.studio in Figma. Those values are referenced in `./src/theme/*` as vanilla-extract tokens.

### Workflow
- Run `generate:tokens` once to transform and build the design tokens in `./src/design-tokens/generated/*`.

or manually by: 
1. Make changes to the design-tokens (token.studio) in Figma and push to main in order to generate `tokens/export-tokens.json`
2. Run `npm run transform:tokens` to generate `./src/design-tokens/design-tokens.json`. This removes any reference, which are not readable by style-dictionary. 
3. run `build:tokens` to generate `./src/design-tokens/generated/*` via style-dictionary (this will also remove the `design-tokens.json` file from previous step).

## Deliverables
[ ]  Implementation of an alternative/adjusted design process workflow (details will be worked out by  Dawn in collaboration with multiple designers and software engineers).
[ ]  Development of a dedicated playground environment for research and testing purposes, providing a practical, real-world illustration.
[ ] Creation of a comprehensive blog post presenting research findings, results, and conclusive insights.

## Notes
- Hot-reload vanilla-extract not working, so refresh after change is necessary
- Flags `--expandTypography`, `--expandShadow` need to be added while calling token-transform in order to spread the objects and to generate the correct output by style-dictionary. If not, the output will result in [object Object].
